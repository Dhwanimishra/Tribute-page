                My father is the strongest person I know both in character and in heart. He has always been a pillar of strength, guiding our family with patience, discipline, and unwavering love. Through every challenge, he remains calm and wise, always putting our needs before his own. His hard work, honesty, and quiet sacrifices have taught me the value of resilience and hamility. I am proud to be his child, and I strive every day to make him proud in return.

                My mother is the heart of our home.Her love is unconditional, and her strength shines through in every small and big thing she does for our family. She has a gentle spirit, yet carries immense courage and wisdom. Whether it's comforting us with her words or inspiring us with her determination, she brings warmth and positivity wherever she goes. Her kindness, patience, and endless support have shaped me into who I am today. She is not only my mother but also my best friend, teacher, and role model.
